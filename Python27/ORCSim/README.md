ORCSim: Organic Rankine Cycle Simulation Tool
====================


ORCSim is a generalized object-orented framework for the detailed simulation of ORC systems.

The structure of the code has been originally derived from [ACHP](https://github.com/TSTK/ACHP) by Emeline Georges (University of Liège). 
Brandon J. Woodland (Purdue University) and Davide Ziviani (Ghent University and Purdue University) have contributed by extending the capabilities of the code and by including the first charge-sensitive solver applied to ORC system.

Two solution schemes are currently implemented:

* condenser outlet subcooling based solver
* working fluid total charge solver

ORCSim has been validated against experimental data. Please cite the framework as:
