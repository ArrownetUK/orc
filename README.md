Welcome to ORCmKit
====================

ORC Modeling Kit (ORCmKit) is a comprehensive open-source library for the modeling of organic Rankine cycle (ORC) power systems.

The library has been originally created by Rémi Dickes (University of Liège) and Davide Ziviani (Ghent University and Purdue University) with the aim to provide ,at a single place, open-source, reliable and validated models for the steady-state simulation of ORCs and to encourage the researchers in the field to actively contribute to share their knowlegde and modeling efforts.

Three main programming languages are supported at the moment: Python, Matlab and EES.

* ORCmKit has flexible licensing terms: MIT

* The documentation is available along with examples

* Issues can be reported here.

The ORCmKit library should be referenced as:
